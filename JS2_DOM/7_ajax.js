// basic theory

// AJAX : asynchronous javascript and xml

// HTTP request

// ajax is a set of "web development technique"
// using many web techniques on the 'clien-side'
// to create asychronous web application

// with ajax, web application can send and retrive
// data from a server asynchronously (in the backgroud)
// without interfering with display and
// behaviour of the existing page

// we don't use data in xml fromat anymore
// we use json now

//  we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
//  1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
//  2. fetch API (new way of doing)
//  3. axios ( this is third party library)


// search : jsontypeicode
// to use api : read document of that api

// the most common type of request routes that we use for api's
// GET : to get something
// POST : to create something
// PUT : to overrite something
// PATCH : to edit something
// DELETE : to delete something
